I have performed two tasks and which were basically a Todo-list and an Alarm Clock.

🎗️ Todo-List basically describes or give details of the task completed , yet to be complete , and putting tick marks on the completion tasks.

🎗️  Alarm clock basically is a normal clock which shows time, and we can set alarm
